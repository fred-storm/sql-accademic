# sql-academic
I have created this repo to work cross platform on SQL projects required for academic studies while pursuing my bachelors degree.  If you find someting in here that helps you please use it.

## Expectations
1) Don't expect to find earth shattering, process changing code in here.  These are fairly simple code blocks created to meet the requirements of classes. 
2) If you find mistakes, I would apreciate you pretending like they don't exist.  I probably alread have this work graded, but if not I would like to fix it on my to work for my grade.  I always welcome help but I have to learn somewhere.
3) The code itself probably won't make since with out the assignment worksheet, and that is ok.  Agian it is my grade.

### Thank you for checking out my repo!
